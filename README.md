a `razee-identity` ConfigMap and Secret manually.  
  - Logon to your RazeeDash server and go to the clusters page
    - ie. `https://app.razee.io/stark-industries/clusters`
  - Click a cluster name and go to the Details tab
  - From there you will see the kubectl commands you can run to generate the `razee-identity` ConfigMap and Secret
  - Now you can add this cluster to a Cluster Group from the Deployables page
